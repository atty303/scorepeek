# scorepeek committed checkpoint

This file describes the state included in the commit that contains it. It is a
replace-in-place checkpoint, not a session log. Uncommitted working-tree state
is outside this checkpoint.

## Current milestone

- Milestone: **M1.2 — live catalog acquisition and sync orchestration**
- State: **in_progress**
- Parent milestone: **M1 — catalog federation and activation** (`in_progress`)

## Included deliverables

- Versioned, strict synthetic fixture contracts for Tachi, Textage, and
  dqn/iidxapi observations, with immutable revision and content evidence.
- Deterministic, fail-closed federation anchored by UUIDv5 Tachi identities;
  exact-match cross-lineage corroboration; revision provenance with
  assertion-level normalization of unchanged evidence; and quarantine for
  ambiguity, identity bridges, critical conflicts, regressions, and provisional
  records.
- Typed title variants, source chart assertions, product/version metadata,
  source bindings and attributes, dqn pack evidence, and explicit INFINITAS
  status.
- Private, content-addressed SQLite snapshots with semantic validation,
  single-writer locking, base-digest conflict detection, atomic manifest
  activation, fsync boundaries, and restrictive permissions.
- Synthetic regression coverage for adapters, federation, provenance,
  last-known-good behavior, deterministic snapshot round-trips, semantic
  tampering, and activation crash points.
- A dependency-free, credential-free dqn/iidxapi live JSON adapter boundary
  that accepts only content-SHA-256-pinned bytes, preserves nullable pack
  evidence, and rejects truncation, schema drift, revision mismatch, and
  duplicate rows before federation.
- A bounded serial dqn acquisition and private content-addressed cache using
  HTTPS-only `ureq`/rustls, a 30-second whole-request timeout, a reject-all
  redirect policy, 1 MiB declared/actual body limit, a 64-revision/64 MiB raw
  cache cap, and an honest scorepeek user agent.
- A strict Tachi live adapter for the exact-commit `songs-iidx`, SP-chart, and
  DP-chart JSON collections. It preserves typed main, alternate, and
  e-amusement CSV titles; imports only primary standard SP/DP charts; excludes
  search terms and known custom chart modes; derives positive INFINITAS evidence
  only from primary chart versions; and rejects schema drift, duplicate IDs,
  orphan charts, inconsistent levels, and duplicate primary chart keys.
- Bounded serial Tachi acquisition that resolves GitHub `main` to a commit,
  fetches raw files only at that commit without executing code, applies a
  30-second whole-request timeout and reject-all redirect policy, and keeps at
  most 8 private verified bundles or 512 MiB.
- A strict Textage live adapter that decodes the three mutable inputs as
  Windows-31J without replacement and parses only their bounded constant,
  assignment, object, array, string, integer, comment, and static `fontcolor`
  grammar without executing JavaScript. It admits `actbl` rows only when their
  title and chart-data rows exist, imports complete standard SP/DP chart slots,
  preserves exact display data after source-specific static formatting
  extraction, and keeps partial chart slots unknown.
- Bounded serial Textage acquisition using HTTPS-only `ureq`/rustls, a
  30-second whole-request timeout, a reject-all redirect policy, 1 MiB per-file
  limits, and a private three-file framed-digest cache capped at 64 revisions
  and 64 MiB.
- `scorepeek catalog sync`, which acquires the existing writer lock before all
  Tachi, Textage, and dqn network access, validates and caches exact bytes,
  federates all three sources against the active catalog, blocks snapshot-wide regressions,
  conditionally activates a durable snapshot under 32-generation,
  128 MiB-per-file, and 512 MiB-total caps, and emits only source evidence and
  aggregate quarantine counts.

## Verified in this checkpoint

- `mise run test`: passed on the development host, including all Rust library
  and binary tests and repository checks.
- The tests use synthetic, independently created fixture data only.
- An isolated live `scorepeek catalog sync` resolved Tachi commit
  `4ef9ca588424e1a98dc73421a49dd8efe3b37ddd`, validated and privately cached its
  three IIDX collections as 17,967 accepted song/chart rows at framed bundle
  SHA-256 `7f64941f017bf09d81f2c6e01a1aae7f23d42678957cfb812788986f8cb87c96`,
  and fetched the 1,879-row dqn response at content SHA-256
  `b92bbba31b8f9c3f968afe8481f65aec411f95d4f211c19f671c67752d8d275d`.
  The combined sync activated 2,548 Tachi-anchored songs at catalog digest
  `7b31c9e7fa72b39a905554ace30b8c46d37e24639b7a31861cf65c748f3da0fa`;
  51 dqn rows remained provisional and the rest resolved without another
  quarantine category. The 74,330,112-byte SQLite snapshot and all raw files
  had private permissions. The temporary private XDG roots, external bytes,
  and generated snapshot were removed after verification and were not added to
  the repository.
- An independent review reproduced a second-revision capacity failure in the
  initial implementation. After unchanged title, chart, and binding assertions
  were normalized across source revisions, the same live Tachi and dqn bytes
  were federated under a distinct 40-hex Tachi revision and published again.
  Both the first and second snapshots were 74,330,112 bytes, while the latest
  source-level revision remained recorded. Synthetic regressions also cover a
  sparse Tachi change and excluded custom/non-primary orphan charts. The
  review-only external bytes and generated snapshots were removed afterward.
- An isolated live three-source `scorepeek catalog sync` reused Tachi commit
  `4ef9ca588424e1a98dc73421a49dd8efe3b37ddd` and the 1,879-row dqn response,
  and decoded, validated, and privately cached the three Textage inputs as
  19,055 accepted song/chart rows at framed bundle SHA-256
  `3c1291f96946279512632ec69e5bf0f8d49ff0b7e301e43457bfe36bd5ad4f81`.
  The candidate activated at catalog digest
  `bc0395b58e6e1a7b6a395be7823d4ca8f15e20c1a1eb29468ecf6c4c9e89da16`;
  711 Textage/dqn records remained provisional and 85 Textage records had
  chart conflicts, with no fuzzy or ambiguous merge. A repeat sync reused one
  Textage cache generation and one byte-identical 85,233,664-byte catalog
  snapshot. All scorepeek cache, manifest, lock, and snapshot paths had private
  permissions. Independent review reproduced cross-revision growth in Textage
  title and binding evidence; semantic assertions now reuse their original
  evidence while the latest source revision remains recorded. Synthetic
  regressions cover both an unchanged revision and a sparse attribute change.

## Unverified and target-only boundaries

- No scheduled synchronization exists. Catalog-update recognition replay,
  private capture corpus, OCR model, capture backend, field recognizer, event
  daemon, and the integrated live flow also remain unvalidated.
- Bazzite Portal, Gamescope, OBS, GPU, lifecycle, performance, and soak gates
  remain target-machine-only and unrun.

## Blockers and required approvals

- `ureq` 3.4.0 with rustls was approved for the bounded live HTTP transport;
  no additional transport dependency is currently required.
- `encoding_rs` 0.8.35 was approved for replacement-free Windows-31J decoding;
  no JavaScript parser dependency is used.
- Any new runtime, parser, capture, or training dependency requires user
  approval after version, license, alternatives, and host/bundle impact are
  presented.
- External-source access and reuse must remain within `docs/sources.md`; a
  source requiring new permission cannot be enabled until that permission is
  obtained.

## Next executable task

Continue **M1.2 — live catalog acquisition and sync orchestration** with daily
jittered scheduled synchronization. The scheduled path must invoke the same
manual `scorepeek catalog sync` entry point, share its single writer lock, keep
network access outside the gameplay daemon, preserve fail-closed exit status
and aggregate-only output, and expose reproducible install/verification tasks.
Do not mark M1 complete until an isolated schedule-triggered sync and concurrent
manual/scheduled serialization both pass. Catalog-update recognition replay
remains part of M8 because it depends on the later recognition pipeline.
